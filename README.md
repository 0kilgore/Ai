# Ai
This code is a Python script that creates a voice-activated personal assistant. The script uses the SpeechRecognition library to recognize and interpret user speech, the pyttsx3 library to speak the assistant's response, and other libraries like datetime, webbrowser, and os for various functionalities.

The script defines several functions:

speak() - takes a string as an input and speaks it out loud using the text-to-speech engine.
get_command() - uses the microphone to record the user's speech and returns the recognized text as a string.
handle_request() - takes the recognized text as an input and performs specific actions based on the user's request. Currently, the script can handle requests for setting reminders, adding tasks to a to-do list, and performing web searches.
The main loop continuously listens for user input using the get_command() function and passes the recognized text to the handle_request() function to perform the corresponding action.
